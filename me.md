**Hello World! Nice to meet you!**

My name is Michael Angelo. I am a data scientist.

There are three things that I love the most in this world:

- Learning about coding, Machine learning and statistics
- Listening to great music
- Dancing salsa

I just started writing about all the new stuffs I am currently learning on this site. I will try to update it frequently.

I also participate in Kaggle competitions. I learned a lot about analytics and modelling through do those competitions. I will share my codes and analysis soon!
